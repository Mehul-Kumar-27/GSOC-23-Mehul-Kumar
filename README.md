# Google Summer Of Code'23 With LibreHealth
This document constitutes my submission for the Google Summer of Code'23 final report. Over the course of GSoC'23, I had the privilege of collaborating with LibreHealth and making significant contributions to their NeoRoo application.

Throughout this period, I embarked on a journey of innovation and collaboration, pushing the boundaries of what the NeoRoo application could achieve. My work spanned various critical aspects, from enhancing user experience to implementing intricate functionalities. This report outlines the key milestones and accomplishments achieved during this enriching experience.

## Project Overview
Around 15 million premature infants are born annually, predominantly in low and middle-income nations, where the risk of neonatal mortality is notably higher. A prevalent issue among preterm births is neonatal hypothermia, a condition that can be effectively mitigated through Kangaroo Mother Care/Skin-to-Skin care (KMC/STS). Nevertheless, the widespread adoption of KMC/STS faces barriers including limited healthcare personnel and the labor-intensive nature of neonatal care. These constraints impede the consistent implementation of KMC/STS on a larger scale.

This project aims to create an automated system for monitoring vital signs, managing multiple patients simultaneously, and enabling collaborative goal setting for education, KMC, and discharge planning. The core objective of this application revolves around issuing prompt alerts to parents and caregivers whenever irregularities in vital signs are detected, thereby preempting adverse outcomes. The feasibility and acceptance of this innovation within US healthcare facilities are currently under evaluation.
